# Weather-Web-App
*Homepage:* Create a homepage that provides a simple user interface. Include a search
input field where users can enter a location (e.g., city or ZIP code) and a "Get Weather"
button to trigger the weather request.
2. *Weather Display:* Display the current weather conditions for the specified location.
Include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. You can
choose a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch this data.
3. *Error Handling:* Implement error handling for cases where the location entered by the
user is not found or when there is an issue with the API request. Display a user-friendly error
message and guide the user on how to proceed.
4. *Unit Selection:* Allow users to switch between temperature units (e.g., Celsius and
Fahrenheit). Implement a toggle or dropdown to switch between units, and ensure that the
weather data is updated accordingly.
5. *Optional: Geolocation:* Offer the option to use the user's geolocation to automatically
fetch the weather for their current location. Ensure that you request and handle geolocation
permissions appropriately.
6. *Styling:* Apply CSS styles to make the app visually appealing and ensure a good user
experience. Pay attention to layout, color scheme, and readability.
7. *Responsive Design:* Ensure that the app is responsive and functions well on both
desktop and mobile devices. Test its usability on various screen sizes.
